Have you ever wanted to add a QR code on printed materials, posters, handwritten notes, etc.? Maybe you have. Then you may have given up because you're too lazy to do the hassle of creating a QR code on your computer, printing it out, cutting it to the appropriate size, and pasting it.

<b>Magic Label™</b>, the innovative pre-printed QR code sticker, is the solution for you! Just read it with your mobile, and then you see a website that sets a website to read. After you set up a website on it, anyone read the website you set as same as a regular QR code. All hassles are gone!

## Have you ever wanted to write down a QR code?
When you are writing down the URL as a reference in a handwritten note, have you ever wanted to write down the QR code for that URL instead?

When you are reading a printed report and writing a reference URL along with your comment, have you wished to write the QR code of that URL?

Typing in a URL to read it is very cumbersome, so the person who should read the URL may feel tedious and hesitate to read it, but <b>if it were a QR code?</b> no need to worry about it.

## Label printer can do, but…
It's almost impossible to handwrite a QR code, so if you want to add a QR code to paper or something else, you'll need to create it separately, print it, and paste it.

The label printers are products to reduce the troublesomeness of this work. Enter a URL as you like, it will create a QR code and print it as a sticker. However, label printers are expensive, cumbersome to carry, and tend to break down. It is hard to feel like buying it and bringing it around all the time just for the opportunity to print a QR code you never know when it will come.

# Magic Label™ is the right solution!
