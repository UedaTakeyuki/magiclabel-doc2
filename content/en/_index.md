Have you ever wanted to add a QR code on printed materials, posters, handwritten notes, etc.? Maybe you have. Then you may have given up because you're too lazy to do the hassle of creating a QR code on your computer, printing it out, cutting it to the appropriate size, and pasting it.

<b>Magic Label™</b>, the innovative pre-printed QR code sticker, is the solution for you! Just read it with your mobile, and then you see a website that sets a website to read. After you set up a website on it, anyone read the website you set as same as a regular QR code. With <i>Magic Label™</i> all your hassles are gone!

After registering, when you read it, after notification to redirect to the registered URL, it opens the website registered as like as a regular QR code.

Of course, the same site will open no matter who reads it on any device.
