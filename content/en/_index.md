## Have you ever wanted to add a QR code on printed materials?

Have you ever wanted to add a QR code on printed materials, posters, handwritten notes, etc.? Maybe you have. Then you may have given up because you're too lazy to do the hassle of creating a QR code on your computer, printing it out, cutting it to the appropriate size, and pasting it.

<b>Magic Label™</b>, the innovative pre-printed QR code sticker, is the solution for you! Just read it with your mobile, and then you see a website that sets a website to read. After you set up a website on it, anyone read the website you set as same as a regular QR code. All hassles are gone!
