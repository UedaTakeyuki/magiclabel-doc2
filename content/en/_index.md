Have you ever wanted to add a **QR code** to Non-digital materials like **printed materials**, **printed posters**, **handwritten notes**, etc.? I guess maybe you have, and I can easily imagine that you may have given up because you're too lazy to do the hassle of a series of tasks:

-- **Start** your PC.  
-- **Make** a QR code on your computer.  
-- **Print** it out by a printer connected to your PC.  
-- **Cut** it to the appropriate size with scissors.  
-- **Past** it on the materials with glue.  

**So tedious**.

<b>Magic Label™</b>, the innovative pre-printed QR code sticker, is the solution for you! Just read it with your mobile, and then you see a website that sets a website to read. After you set up a website on it, anyone read the website you set as same as a regular QR code. With <i>Magic Label™</i> all your hassles are gone!

After registering a URL, when someone reads it, a notification to redirect to the registered URL appears and **opens the website registered** by you earlier, as like as an **ordinary QR code**.
