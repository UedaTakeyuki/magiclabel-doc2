# Our beliefs
{.text-center}

{{% /blocks/section %}}
1. to have genuine <b>ideas</b> to express;
2. to study the <b>coding</b> attentively, so as to know how to express them;
3. to sympathize with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous <b>software products</b>, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote; and
4. most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good <b>software products</b>.

These are homages to the [doctrines of the Pre-Raphaelites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite_Brotherhood#Early_doctrines). When I identified with it, I realized that they also applied to making software products, and when I changed the words appropriately, I was convinced that these were exactly the beliefs I should espouse.
